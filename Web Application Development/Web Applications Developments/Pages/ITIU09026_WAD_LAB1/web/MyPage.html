                <p>
                    First of all, I want to thank each and every one of you for visiting my webpage. Next, I will introduce a little bit about me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Trong Tin and I am currently study Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh International University. 
                    My speciality focuses most on the software development and programming. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to become a software engineering, who field of expertise is software or technical.
                    I write this webpage to share with every one my information or some interesting stuffs (game, pictures, etc...) to see if anyone has the same interest as me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another reason is that, my skills in web development, especially my design skills, is not good. 
                    As I make this webpage public, many people can see, and give me feedback, about my website, in order to improve my page as well as my skills as programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, my website is still under construction, so, please give me your comment about it as much as you can. I give my best regard to every one, please come, check and enjoy my website.
