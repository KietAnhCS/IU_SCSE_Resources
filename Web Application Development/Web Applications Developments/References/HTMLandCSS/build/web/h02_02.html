              <h3>Art in Public Places</h3>
              <p>The Art in Public Places project has installed a mural, a photo of which you see on the left, on the library courtyard wall.</p>
              <p>This mutual has provoked a lot of criticism in the local press and among library patrons. Many people consider it too simplistic to be considered art. Others say that art can be defined as anything that decorates or enhances. In my opinion, this art is the work of an amateur and should be stripped from the library wall immediatedly</p>
