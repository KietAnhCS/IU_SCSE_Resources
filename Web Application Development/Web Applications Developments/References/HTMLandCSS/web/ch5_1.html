                  on air can come true. We design and make hot air balloons for
                  every use. Our balloons will give you a magical ride over
                  country, mountains, and ocean.</p>
              <p>Come to our famous build-a-balloon design shop and you can enjoy
                  a test flight in one of our many pre-made balloons. We organized
                  birthday, anniversary, wedding, honeymoon and many other special
                  occasion balloon flights for up to 100 people!</p>
              <p>Inside there pages you can examine some of the many example balloon
                  photos as seen at balloon races, fiestas and rallies all around the world.</p>

                  begin your fun by coming by our Balloon Museum or our famous
                  build-a-balloon design shop. Both are located in Timbuktu on the
                  Avon right off US Interstate Highway 165</p>
              <h2>The Balloon Museum</h2>
              <p>See balloons form history and do experiments with the science of air. 
                  Stand in the same gondola that went around the world in 90 days and never
                  made history. Thrill to the roar of the gas burners and the silence of the
                  wind in our ballon flight simulator with surround sound and rock-a-billy
                  motion enhancers.</p>
              <p>Our Balloon Museum computers will let you design your own patterns and
                  shapes for the balloon in your future. So get here now !</p>
